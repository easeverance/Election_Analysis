 ## Election Audit Summary
 In summary the code that was provided can be expanded/modified to show needed information for any election.  For instance the code could be modified to show the percentage of votes that were received by each candidate in each county. This can be done by initializing new variables and pulling the information based off of these new variables from the dictionaries and lists.   
 
 Two counties, Jefferson and Arapahoe had very low voter turnout.  Additional information could be added to the CSV file, such as voter age, demographic etc. that could be used to figure out why the low turnout. 
 
 Finally, the file could be used on a national scale.  Information could be added to see voter trends compared to other states. Or voter trends by each county based off of the national average of counties of similar size and make up.
